/* ******************* player_new ************************************** */
/* This function allocates space for and 
 * initiates a new player struct.
 *
 * We assume:
 *   caller provides string for player's name, positive integer
 *   for playerNumber, starting position of player, the current
 *   spectatorGrid, and the originalMap for the game
 * 
 * We return:
 *   The pointer to the newly created player struct, 
 *    NULL if error or parameters invalid.
 *   
 * We guarantee:
 *   The module is responsible for malloc'ing memory for the player's name
 *   and later free'ing it, thus the name string need not be malloc'd.
 *   All relevant information for the player (including his visible grid)
 *   is initiated appropriately.
 *   
 * Caller is responsible for:
 *   Later calling player_delete() to free the returned pointer.
 *   
 * IMPORTANT:
 *   * The function assumes that a valid starting position is provided for 
 *     the player (this is determined by a random procedure in add_player())
 *   * The function does not verify the uniqueness and validity 
 *     of playerNumber (the higher-level add_player() is responsible for that)  
 *   * The function only uses the spectatorGrid for reference, and is not 
 *     responsible for updating it with the new player's character 
 *      (the higher-level add_player() is responsible for that)
 *   * The player stores no copy of originalMap, which is shared by all player
 *     structs and must not be deleted nor changed until the end of the game

/* ******************* player_updateGrid ************************************** */
/* This function is used to update the current visible grid of a player
 * after any change in the game.
 *
 * We assume:
 *   Pointers are casted to void* in order to use this function as parameter
 *   for hashtable_iterate() on the hashtable of all players in the game, updating
 *   their grids simultaneously.
 *     Hence, the caller provides the updated spectator grid, the hashtable of players
 *   in the game, and this function as parameters for hashtable_iterate().
 * 
 * We return:
 *   Nothing (void).
 *   
 * We guarantee:
 *   The player's currently visible grid is updated to reflect any changes in the
 *   game. 
 *   
 * IMPORTANT:
 *   Before calling this function, the caller must ensure that
 *   1) The player's position playerp -> pos is updated
 *   2) The spactator grid spectGrid is updated
 *   The grid is updated only for currently active players. 
 *   Once a player leaves the game its grid will not be updated anymore.

 * 
 * We guarantee:
 *   All the memory previously malloc'd by the player struct and its
 *   attributes is free'd. NULL pointers are ignored
 *   
 * Notes:
 *  Pointer is cast to void* to use this function as parameter to hashtable_delete()

 *
 * We assume:
 *   This function is designed to be used as a parameter to hashtable_iterate().
 *   caller provides hashtable of players, character pointer for array where 
 *   player's information needs to be added, and this function player_print
 *   as parameters to hashtable_iterate().
 *
